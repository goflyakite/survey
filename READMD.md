# Survey, instead of Surveillance

My first eosio coding, basically like a hello world program.

This is from the eosio course at: https://training.eos.io/courses/take/smart-contracts-101 I have opted to place it here because I had troubles getting it to work at first and found no one who had it available for me to reference. I did email  "support" but got a resounding emptiness.

In my code I don't like the word surveillance, it feels creepy, quite long, and I do not like how it's spelled.

I have opted to shorten "surveillance" to "survey".


## History

Good milestones.
